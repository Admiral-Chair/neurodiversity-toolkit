                <h2>Call to Action: We need to organise!</h2>

                <p class="small-text">Date: 4th of June 2023</p>

                <br>

                <p>We need a united front!</p>

                <p>It's true, we the collective neurodivergent community must organise a grass roots mass movement for neurodiversity and disability rights!</p>

                <br>

                <p>While not everyone will see the point of this, in the coming days, weeks, and months; I will continue to argue and plan for this united front to be born.</p>

                <br>

                <p>The organisation that I wish to help found is a collective organisation made up of:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Organisations</li>
                    <li>Communities</li>
                    <li>Action Groups</li>
                    <li>Affiliates</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <p>All of these will play an important and decisive role inside the collective organisation, and will play to their strengths, and collectively cover up each others weaknesses.</p>

                <br>

                <h3>What makes this organisation any different from any others?</h3>

                <br>

                <p>By far the most important fact in my opinion is the principle of intersectionality. This means a real attempt as fulfilling the promise of:</p>
                
                <br>

                <p class="outline-italic">Nothing about us; without us!</p>

                <br>

                <p>This means that is isn't just a club for Lower Support Needs Autistic's and the occasional ADHDer. This is for all neurodivergent minds!</p>

                <br>

                <p>This means an internationalist, intersectional organisation which actually takes all voices into consideration, and demands total solidarity with all comrades of brain.</p>

                <br>

                <h4>Sceptical about if this really means all minds?</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Do be, because I need YOUR voice, so we can try and make an organisation which represents ALL MINDS!</p>
                <br>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neurological_conditions_and_disorders"><p>This quite literally means all minds.</p></a>

                <br>

                <p>I do not consider our work done until ALL support needs are met and we have a society where equality prevails!</p>

                <br>

                <p>However... That means I need your help!</p>

                <br>

                <p>For the moment, I am focusing on trying to get reddit subreddits to agree to a partnership in order to form said collective organisation. Reddit communities are but one manifestation of online community I wish to bring into the fold. For this reason I have created a link which could be used to share this with reddit.</p>

                <br>

                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/submit?title=(Make+it+something+actually+descriptive+and+select+a+relevant+subreddit)&url=https://admiral-chair.github.io/neurodiversity-toolkit/pages/announcements.html"><p>Share to Reddit</p></a>

                <br>

                <p>This does not mean only reddit however, if this proposal interests you and you know a community which would like to join, or if you would like to form an Action Group and support our efforts...</p>
