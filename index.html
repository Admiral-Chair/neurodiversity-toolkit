        <p>Hello and welcome to Chair's Neurodiversity Toolkit! I wish to try and unify a bunch of infomation into one source which can be used to help inform people about the Neurodiversity movement and struggle. I am Admiral Chair, an AuDHDer (Autistic ADHDer) Marxist, who has a passion for history, politics, geography, and apparently also this. You don't necessarily have to agree with me politically. But I mention it as my bias is towards Marxism. An ideology about dialectical materialism, class struggle, the abolition of capitalism, and scientific socialism.</p>

        <br>

        <p>To many, that just sounds like a bunch of word soup. That is alright, there is a glossery for more difficult words on this website. Including basic definitions key to the Neurodiversity movement and its terminology.</p>

        <br>

        <p></p>

        <br>

        <h2>What is Neurodiversity?</h2>

        <br>

        <a href="#">Here is a 101 about Intersectional Neurodiversity</a>

        <br>

        <p>Neurodiversity is different things to different people. However, among all of the views about Neurodiversity, I personally feel that Neurodiversity as an ideology driven social movement with a philosophical and scientific wing is the most accurate way to describe it. It is not exclusivly any of these things, it is all of them.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Neurodiversity is a civil rights movement dedicated to the celebration of and the attainment of all support needs for those who are part of the total neurological diversity of humanity. The total neurological diversity of humanity includes Neurodivergents and Neurotypicals alike. Collectively we as a species are Neurodiverse.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Basic terminology:</h3>

        <br>

        <h4 class="outline-underline">Neurotype:</h4>

        <p>A Neurotype is merely an expression/term to describe the neurological state of an individual. This contains any and all, personality traits, disorders, disabilities, conditions, and etc. It is akin to a kind of neurological identity, like an ethnicity or creed. No neurotype is exactly the same, but when talking about them we categorise them into spectrums. Like the Autism Spectrum being one of the most well known neurotypes.</p>

        <br>

        <h4 class="outline-underline">Neurotypical:</h4>

        <p>Neurotypical is the term to describe the hegemonic region of the neurological spectrum, this is made up of personality traits, and brain function which is not stigmatised, marginalised, oppressed, or pathologised, in a general sense of the word.</p>

        <br>

        <h4 class="outline-underline">Neurodivergent:</h4>

        <p>Neurodivergent is the term to essentially describe the opposite of Neurotypical. It is the non-hegemonic of the neurological spectrum, this is made up of personality traits, disorders, conditions, disabilities, and other brain functions which are either oppressed, pathologised, or marginalised, in a general sense of the word. Neurodivergent isn't a disorder, disability, or politically correct term for such things, Neurodivergent is merely a category which has been created to group all of the non-hegemonic neurotypes into one concise and easy to use category.</p>

        <br>

        <h4 class="outline-underline">Neurodiverse:</h4>

        <p>Neurodiversity itself is as said before, different things to different people, but the root word is Neurodiverse. This is tricky to understand, but a person cannot be neurodiverse, this is typicially a bit of terminology which is often misused by activists and media but the distinction is important and necessary. Neurodiversity is about the celebration of the total neurological diversity of humanity. So in that regard, all neurodiverse is, is the spectrum of neurotypes themselves. Which means all of the neurotypes, - neurotypical and neurodivergent alike – which make up the neurodiverse spectrum.</p>

        <!-- <br>
        
        <h4 class="outline-underline">Neuroatypical:</h4>

        <p>Neuroatypical is a complicated one. It is a type of terminology which should be carefully evaluated on a case by case basis. This is a more rare term which may get used to interchangeably refer to neurodivergent people, or to describe a unforseen grey area between non-hegemonic and hegemonic neurotypes. This is most often applied to the understanding most mood disorders. Like depression, anxiety, PTSD, amnesia, and others. It could also be applied to common neurological conditions which occur later in life or come about through unfortunate circumstances. This includes things such as: dementia, Parkinson’s, brain tumours, traumatic head injuries, concussions, brain haemorrhages, and other such conditions.</p>

        <br>

        <p>These conditions and grey area neurotypes may be misunderstood, but they generally under most circumstances do not receive marginalisation or oppression from it, as they are generally understood by society as not the fault of those with said conditions, but depending on which condition, this understanding may be far from universal.</p>

        <br>

        <p>While this understanding of the term greatly differs from many other interpretations, I believe this is the most useful use for such a term if at all. In Intersectional Neurodiversity, there needs to be room for the grey areas of our reality, so hence why I include this definition.</p> -->

        <br>

        <h4 class="outline-underline">Neurodivergence:</h4>

        <p>This term is essentially a blanket adjective for neurodivergent neurotypes. To use it in a sentence as an example, this is a way I would use it:</p>

        <br>

        <p class="outline-italic">My neurodivergence gives me many challenges I must face on a daily basis, things would be far easier for me, if people just chose to educate themselves about neurodivergence and neurodiversity.</p>

        <br>

        <p>The root word of neurodivergence is neurodiverge. This could be used in a sentence like:</p>

        <br>

        <p class="outline-italic">The primary objective of Neurodiversity, is the liberation of all those who neurodiverge from the oppressive rules and standards of neurotypical society. This hegemony deprives us of dignity, respect, support, accommodation, and the means of self-determination and subsistence. It is not just another letter of the progressive alphabet, it is about our basic and fundamental human rights which we have been deprived!</p>
