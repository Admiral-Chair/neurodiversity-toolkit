        <p>CINOA for the moment is a mere hypothetical collective; made up of a collective of advocates, organisations, and communities which already exist. This would be in the form of an online united front which exists for the planning, organisation, and execution of various online strategies in line with a doctrine of agitation, education, and organising. With a strong desire for solidarity and a united offensive.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is a mere proof of concept and I will be borrowing lots of the doctrine from a piece I previously wrote about a hypothetical collective organisation of organisations against Judge Rotenberg Education Center.</p>

        <h2 id="hypothetical-strategic-doctrine">Hypothetical Strategic Doctrine:</h2>
        <ol class="lighter-background">
            <li>Create a network of subreddit moderators, to brainstorm and coordinate plans and community operations.</li>
            <li>Allow community involvement and democracy to get suggestions and ideas from community members on what would be a good idea to organise. (On each individual subreddits and mods bring ideas to the network table)</li>
            <li>Successfully coordinate memetic strikes against Judge Rotenburg Center.</li>
            <li>Understand the importance of long term longevity of the movement to prevent burnout or the phenomenon of everyone going back to brunch after a victory and not continuing Neurodiversity struggle.</li>
            <li>Successfully coordinate operations with already existing movements.</li>
            <li>A Intersectional Neurodiversity Network must not make partisan issues issues to solve at the network table as anti-factionalism is a key doctrine. Any and all partisan issues among the disability rights movements must be solved elsewhere and shouldn't be dragged into network discussions.</li>
            <li>Attempt to bring in YouTubers, and non-reddit communities into the fold. In an attempt to broaden the scope of network operations.</li>
            <li>NEVER TALK TO THE MEDIA IF YOU DON'T HAVE MEDIA TRAINING! This is essential, do not forget what happened to r/antiwork, do not let it happen to us. And if you talk to the media... MAKE SURE IT'S MEDIA YOU KNOW THAT IS OUTRIGHT SUPPORTIVE OF OUR GOAL AND UNDERSTANDS AND HELPS YOU WITH LACK OF MEDIA TRAINING!</li>
            <li>Once such network is strong enough, attempt to formalise it into an inherent institution of our movement. This means we are far more centralised then other online movements, which gives us a greater ability to coordinate and possibly even move up to outdoors mass movements if possible.</li>
            <li>This is explicitly an attempt to create a Neurodiversity political force with grass roots foundations and policy direction. Interpersonal drama is an explicit threat to the movement and all must remember that this should beyond specific individuals and this is towards a collective struggle for a brighter future. This doesn't mean organisers should all be on best terms and should sit through discomfort. But mod teams themselves engage with other mod teams as one, to prevent interpersonal flare up. Your loyalty is to your sub consistency and the movement. Don't let it be personal, by engaging as groups.</li>
            <li>Mental Health breaks are IMPORTANT, we understand that moderators are Human and all of this would be lots of pressure. Ideally for the most user participation and retention of mass and collective action, spacing out these strikes or operations is an essential part to maintaining the passion of such a movement. So in a same light, this also applies to the top level of the network, DO NOT overwork and burn yourselves out. The key here is that once we beat JRC, we keep fighting. JRC allows our movement to have a baptism in fire. If we beat JRC it must be remembered this is just the beginning.</li>
            <li>Doomerism and apathy is defeat. We must remember that the modern world as we know it was built on movements and struggles just like these. Look to the past for inspiration and pride. Remember Stonewall, remember the suffrage movement, the right to vote, the 8 hour work day... Maybe not all of these even apply some some of our comrades of brains countries, but when I look at Bastille day or the 13th Amendment in the United States, I do not see them as a national struggle, I see them as Humanist struggle in general. In an international sense I find pride in our Human trials against Human tyranny. Maybe you have a different perspective. But remember this... People have faced worse odds and come out on top. REMEMBER THIS AND INTERNALISE THIS!</li>
            <li>SOLIDARITY FOREVER! This is simple, but we must internalise this phrase.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2 id="hypothetical-tactical-doctrine">Hypothetical Tactical Doctrine:</h2>
        <ol class="lighter-background">
            <li class="outline-bold">Meme War</li>

            <p>Meme war does sound silly, but do not underestimate what a meme war can do. Memes are in a sense modern propaganda, and we must be honest that those who take part are themselves propagandists which isn't inherently negative. Memes could be normal memes and macros, or art and copypastas. Meme war is legitimately an effective tactic in the modern world. Make sure to weaponize it to its fullest potential. In calling for organisation of the communities and the proceeding strikes and operations preceding it.</p>

            <li class="outline-bold">Make essays, videos, comments, posts, music, games, and art. Weaponize talent.</li>

            <p>If we are to build a movement we need lots of ideas, formalised ideas that can change peoples minds and perspectives. Remember who we are for a second, the autistic community, so many people with amazing and quite hyper specific talents. Weaponize your talent for our struggle. But most importantly, get the word around.</p>

            <li class="outline-bold">EDUCATE AND AGITATE!</li>

            <p>This is simple, be really annoying about this, when you can, educate people about JRC, and agitate our positions when possible.</p>

            <li class="outline-bold">Don't burn yourself out.</li>

            <p>Just like for the previous list, sustain your passion by doing it when you feel like it, not when you don't feel as such. Our success relies on all of us sustaining our siege until we reach a better world. Not just climbing a few steps.</p>

            <li class="outline-bold">Diplomacy and Optics</li>

            <p>You aren't forced to police your tone, this is only my suggestions. But generally speaking people are more amenable to your ideas when you put it in a tone they appreciate. This is merely a point of tactics. But never personally attack anyone you are trying to educate or agitate to, because they will be less receptive.</p>

            <li class="outline-bold">Understand and have a grasp of how algorithms work and drive attention.</li>

            <p>This means you can spread you ideas more effectively, such as posting during the most effective times pf the day, having catchy or eye grabbing works or thumbnails. And generally anything that helps boost the amount of eyes that skim around your activism.</p>

        <p>I will make a more expansive self-criticism later but I will sum it up into dot points for the moment.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Risks engaging with commandist style organisation. - Aka it needs to avoid shouting into a breeze which is going a different direction or opposite direction entirely.</li>

            <li>While intended to try and reach all kinds of Neurodiversity, it clearly is over reliant on cultural attitudes inside the Autistic and ADHD communities. A greater diversity of views is needed to really represent the whole Neurodivergent community;</li>

            <li>Admiral Chair is but one demagogue in the void, more manpower is needed to try and actually spread such ideals.</li>

            <li>It is likely that Admiral Chair's own open bias might not smooth over well with the entire Neurodivergent community.</li>

            <li>Has yet to provide a strategy and tactics hypothetical which isn't based around the Autistic community. <a href="https://github.com/Admiral-Chair/Neurodiversity_Political_Strategy/blob/main/CALL_TO_ACTION_Demand_Community_Leadership_To_Organise_Against_JRC.md">More Context - Aka the original source of the strategic and tactics hypotheticals.</a></li>

            <li>More needs to be done to integrate physically disabled people into the discussion as Neurodiversity is merely a front of the wider disability rights movement. Hence solidarity must extend to physical disabilities as well; however little effort so far has been made to integrate them.</li>

            <li>More needs to be done to truly entrench a truly internationalist & intersectional movement.</li>

            <li>Admiral Chair must actually demonstrate how the Organisations, Communities, and Action Groups actually should interact, be established, or even which category each group fits into. Especially what an Action Group is or even does.</li>

            <li>Well intentioned may I be, but without me actually advancing the line forward towards an actual united front, all of my words will come off as shouting into the wind, until I can actually demonstrate that said united front has utility and that I am the right person to help initiate it;</li>

            <li>To truly demonstrate this, more communities need to be added to the discussion, but only limited attempts to this end have been made. Although it is not believed that such a movement needs to spread like wildfire, the pace does in fact need to increase as the clock is always ticking.</li>
