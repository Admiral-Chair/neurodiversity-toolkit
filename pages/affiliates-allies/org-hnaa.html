        <h2>About HNAA:</h2>

        <br>

        <p>We at HNAA aim to give voice and assist higher needs autistic people in advocating themselves. We are tired of people speaking over us. Our goal is to promote awareness of Level 2s/3s and their experiences and desires. And help put an end to the excessive amount of ableism and abuse we experience as Level 2/3s. But this movement isn't just about Level 2s/3s it also wants to stop people from trying to say autism isn't a disability or opting it as some new fangled identity.</p>

        <br>

        <p>We want to promote the understanding and support of all autistics, so they cna live better happier lives. The best way we can think of to do that is to give voices to those who struggle to communicate.</p>

        <br>

        <p>The basic idea is to have a central structure of higher needs autistic people then have an outer structure of allies who help advocate for us. But just because you aren't level 2/3 doesn't mean you are excluded from discussion either. Our goal is to give those who struggle to be heard a platform to speak. To raise awareness and combat misinformation. To spread awareness of what life is really like as a higher needs autistic individual.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Right now we are small but the hope is we can grow into a large organization that helps higher needs autistic people be heard around the globe. But as high needs autistic people we are very limited, Which is where the allies come in. It's your job to help advocate for our ideas and help get them out there. This does not mean speaking for us But amplifying our voices. and Helping us advocate for ourselves when we don't have the energy too.</p>

        <br>

        <p>The goal is to ultimately bring people together everyone affected by autism by raising those who are less able up to a place where they can meet people on even ground. To promote unity. Our vision is to have a place where all people affected by autism whether you are a Level 2/3 a Level 1 a caregiver a professional can exist in harmony without division.</p>
