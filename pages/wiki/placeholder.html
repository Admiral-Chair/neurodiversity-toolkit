        <p>Placeholder Disorder, also known as PD, is a placeholder for a wiki page. Theoretically, placeholder disorder is the most widely occuring disorder in the world; approximately 100% of the Human population is known to have placeholder disorder. This disorder is less often diagnosed among women and racial minorities because of various socio-economic factors such as whether you are born or not, or if you have reached a point in life where life no longer exists.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Placeholder disorder neither exists or doesn't exist. It exists solely as a placeholder in the place of an actual diagnosis. You can and cannot be diagnosed with Placeholder disorder by a doctor.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Here are the common or uncommon symptoms of Placeholder Disorder (PD):</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Was born before 1900;</li>
            <li>Was born in 1900;</li>
            <li>Was born after 1900;</li>
            <li>Is alive;</li>
            <li>Is the opposite of alive;</li>
            <li>Shares the same plane of existance;</li>
            <li>Doesn't share the same plane of existance;</li>
            <li>Uses Google;</li>
            <li>Doesn't use Google;</li>
            <li>Uses contradictory infomation;</li>
            <li>Doesn't use contradictory infomation;</li>
            <li>Hasn't had a existential crisis;</li>
            <li>Has an existential crisis;</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <p>For these reasons, people with placeholder disorder experiance various challenges throughout life. They feel as if they were born a placeholder. Generally through active intervention, this disorder can be treated. But that doesn't mean people with PD are treated with respect, in fact people with PD prefer first person language and prefer you to say 'Placeholder Person' rather than 'People with Placeholder Disorder', however people with PD have an average IQ of 100, hence for the sake of this exercise we will be simply refering to children with PD or your PD child since we don't care about your feelings, and adults don't ever want to learn about themselves because thats what women do!</p>

        <br>

        <p>REAL MEN, sort out their feelings by bottling them all up and then then only showing them when you want to explode!</p>

        <br>

        <h2>The History of Placeholder Disorder:</h2>

        <br>

        <p>In 1900, a man called: Mohammad Smith Placeholder, was walking around one day and he bumped into an apple tree. An apple landed on his head and knocked him out. It turns out the apple was directly from the garden of eden! it actually fell from space and hit him in the face!</p>

        <br>

        <p>He woke up! It turns out it was all just a dream! But he felt different. He felt like, he had to figure something out about his dream, so he created Placeholder Philosophy, and diagnosed himself with Placeholder disorder. However his family told him placeholder disorder wasn't real. They were right, but he wanted to prove them wrong anyway!</p>

        <br>

        <p>After years of scheming in 1952, he was working at the printing press for the original DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) and he snuck the phrase Placeholder Disorder into the DSM and gave it a brief description. This was the description:</p>

        <br>

        <p class="outline-italic">They use googleplex as a number when its not really a number! Contradictory much? hmmm... 1900 1900 1900! Share or don't share the same plane of existance! I am the glorious and death! destroyer of worlds and I live!</p>

        <br>

        <p>In 1968, the DSM II removed Placeholder Disorder since they said quote: </p>
        
        <br>
        
        <p class="outline-italic">"We belive that whoever did this was gay, PD has too much overlap with homosexuality! Hence we demand this gay person come forward and own up to what they did!"</p>

        <br>

        <p>Mohammad Smith Placeholder never ended up coming forward, and still to this day, the creators of the DSM still want to know who it was so they can sue the ever living heck out of someone, even if the satut of limitations has already expired, because they are rich and have lots of money.</p>

        <br>

        <p>As for Mohammad Smith Placeholder, he has PD, it is unknown if he is alive or the oppisote of alive, since that is a common or uncommon symptom of PD. But we do know Mohammad Smith Placeholder's home address and phone number, he is approximately 158 years old. Or as he put it:</p>

        <br>

        <p class="outline-italic">"I am extremely old, I think I was born sometime between the birth of the Paris Commune and the Fall of Rome. And by the Fall of Rome, I mean 1944. I actually have pictures from the time, do you wish to see them?"</p>

        <br>

        <p>They were stunning images. Anyway, that is the history of Placeholder Disorder.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Treating Placeholder Disorder:</h2>
        
        <br>

        <p>You can't. But you could try:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Using a planner.</li>
            <li>Adopting the hussle mindset and become your own boss. (Also known as petty bourgeois asperations - also known as lying to yourself)</li>
            <li>Think rich, and grow rich!</li>
            <li>Buying a house instead of renting.</li>
            <li>Wait for Ronald Reagen's trickle down.</li>
            <li>Take intiative and trickle down on Margret Thatchers grave.</li>
            <li>Meditation</li>
            <li>Idk, what else annoying advice exists which is far too vague or just downright shilling for you to buy some rich self help guru's book and only make them richer. Or some corpo garbage politics person. We will never know...</li>
        </ul>
